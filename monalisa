        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Mona Lisa, also called Portrait of Lisa Gherardini, 
            wife of Francesco del Giocondo, Italian La Gioconda, 
            or French La Joconde, oil painting on a poplar wood 
            panel by Leonardo da Vinci, probably the world’s most 
            famous painting. It was painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, 
            when Leonardo was living in Florence, and it now hangs 
            in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where it remained an 
            object of pilgrimage in the 21st century. The sitter’s 
            mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made 
            the painting a source of ongoing investigation and 
            fascination.
